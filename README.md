# Simulation and machine learning of Random Walk with time dependent probability
The goal of this project is to generate two types of random walk: the standard case or regular and the special case(which is an alternating time step). We want to be able to see if the machine is able to recognize and distinguish the two apart. The methods we will be using from machine learning is supervised learning with log regression since this is the beginning stage of the project and these methods were the easiest ones to do.
